    <h1>Understanding White Space</h1>

    <p>
        In HTML, extra        spaces are collapsed into a single space.  
        Even if you add many spaces,          the browser shows only one.
    </p>

    <p>
        To force a new line without starting a new paragraph,  
        you can use the <br> tag. <br> Like this, <br> and this.
    </p>

    <p>
        But if you want to separate blocks of text,  
        you should use paragraph tags <p>.  
    </p>
